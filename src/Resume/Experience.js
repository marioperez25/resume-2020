                <ListItem>Accenture | 2013 - OnGoing | Currently Iâ€™m a Software Developer for an Agroscience client. Amongst my duties I'm responsible for developing AEM components as well as leading the front end Development team and providing coaching to less experienced Developers,  Also I teach a Git and Git-Flow course for other Devs.  Prior to 2020 I performed as a Front End Developer for a fully remote telecom company where I was responsible for creating responsive sites that provide their customers with up-to-date info about plans and pricing. My contributions to the team include automating the data entry process using async calls, the automation of image sprite creation via gulp, as well as promoting the use of ES6 and the implementation of BABEL as part of  our build process allowing us to work with modern JavaScript features (ES6), later upgraded to a Webpack graph to improve performance and add modularity to our JS.
